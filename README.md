# Fokus

Fitness Desktop App to visualise daily acitivities, food consumption and weight change using a week by week view model. While similar to already established apps out there suchas MyFitnessPal and Gym specific tracking apps, I've not seen a WPF desktop app that shows me progress like thie mobile apps can. Probably for good reason as well, WPF isn't everyone's first choice for building a system like this but it's a small project for me to work on to showcase some of my development skills that I've learnt over my time being properly exposed to WPF C# Desktop Applications.
